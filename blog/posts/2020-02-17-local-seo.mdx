    Every website — regardless if they sell anything online — needs some degree
    of SEO to comply with search engine quality guidelines and meet ranking
    factors.

  By focusing on semantics and the users' search intent, you can deliver
  accurate results with high-quality content. By utilizing structured data and
  schema markup, you can help search engines to better understand your website.

<h2 className="pt-4 pb-3">SEO Is Important For Every Small Business</h2>

How do your potential customers find your business on search engines like Google and Bing?

Of course, they can perform an exact match search for your business name and easily come across your website. However, this only happens if the user is already aware of your business.

Will customers find you just by searching for a specific problem that's relevant to your products or services?

This depends on many factors, such as:

- Website structure
- Content relevancy
- Competing websites
- Page load speed
- User experience

Wouldn't it be nice if your name was listed at the top of the results pages every time a user searched for a topic, product, or service relevant to your business?

I bet that would drive more quality leads to your website and result in higher conversion rates.

<strong className="text-info">This is where SEO comes in!</strong>

  SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing your website to
  make a positive and noticeable impact on user experience and performance
  within organic search results.
</p>

By strategically targeting long-tail keywords, providing high-quality content that is accurate, and delivering the information in a format expected by the user, you can greatly increase the ranking position of any page on your website.
